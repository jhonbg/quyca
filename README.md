.env.prod to deploy the code in a production environment.
.env.dev to deploy the code in a development environment.

## Data 
Required data is stored in MongoDB, produced with kahi.
usually  database named kahi or kahi_dev, please read 



# Usage

make up-dev  # to call "docker-compose up -d" for development
```
or
```bash
make up-prod  # to call "docker-compose up -d" for production
```

## Running tests
```bash
make tests-dev    # to run the tests
```
could be the same for prod with 
```bash
make tests-prod    # to run the tests
```
